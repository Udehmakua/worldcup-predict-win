/**
 * Campaign configuration — edit weekly.
 *
 * HOW TO UPDATE EACH WEEK:
 * 1. Change `WEEKLY_MATCHES` below — replace the 5 fixtures.
 *    - `kickoff` MUST be an ISO timestamp in UTC (Z suffix).
 *    - Nigeria (WAT) is UTC+1, so subtract 1 hour from local time.
 *      e.g. Fri 12 Jun 2026 03:00 WAT  →  "2026-06-12T02:00:00Z"
 * 2. Bump `CURRENT_WEEK` (and `CURRENT_YEAR` in January) so the
 *    database treats this as a new week and lets users submit again.
 * 3. `WEEKLY_DEADLINE` is the countdown shown in the hero banner AND
 *    the moment the whole prediction section locks. Set it to the
 *    kickoff of MATCH 1 (the earliest match).
 * 4. For any new country, add a flag entry in `src/components/landing/Flag.tsx`.
 *
 * `PREDICTIONS_ENABLED`: master switch — set to `false` to hide the
 * prediction section entirely (e.g. between campaigns).
